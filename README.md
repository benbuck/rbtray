# rbtray
A minor fork of RBTray from http://sourceforge.net/p/rbtray/code/

The only change is to additionally allow minimizing a window using the shift key while right-clicking in the title bar, since some windows have custom minimize button controls that prevent the existing method from working.

Version 4.5
Add some error handling.
Fix bug in shift key check.
Update project files to VS2015.

Version 4.6
Fix compatibility issue with some Windows 10 64 bit environments.

Version 4.7
